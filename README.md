Comment Popularity adds the ability for logged in users to vote on comments.

## Description ##

With this plugin, members of your site will be able to vote comments up or down. Think Reddit comments.

After activating the plugin, there will be up/down arrows next to each comment and the total weight of the comment.
Comments are sorted by weight in a descending order.

Each commenter is allocated karma each time that one of their comments are upvoted.

Admin users can give users the "expert" label which will attribute more weight to their comments.

You'll find an option under discussion for the default expert karma and it can also be changed on the user's profile.

Follow development of this plugin on [Github](https://github.com/humanmade/comment-popularity/)

Requires PHP `5.3.2` or newer.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Can anonymous visitors vote on comments? ###

Yes, you can enable guest voting by adding this snippet to a mu-plugin:
`add_filter( 'hmn_cp_allow_guest_voting', '__return_true' );`

Please note that it uses cookies and IP addresses to identify a visitor. This is not as reliable as
requiring a user to create an account. Cookies can be deleted, and IP addresses can be shared.

### Can I limit comment weight to positive values only? ###

Yes, you can enable non-negative weights only by adding this snippet to a mu-plugin:
`add_filter( 'hmn_cp_allow_negative_comment_weight', '__return_false' );` 
Bear in mind that this results in a [double-voting issue](https://github.com/humanmade/comment-popularity/issues/113) 

### Can I disable the sorting by comment weight? ###

Yes, add this snippet to your functions.php file or mu plugin:
`add_filter( 'hmn_cp_sort_comments_by_weight', '__return_false' );`

### Where do I find the plugin settings? ###

Under Settings > Discussion, and Users > Profile

### Advanced Usage ###

**I want to use this with a custom comment template.**

First thing - you need to remove the default comments template added by the plugin.

`add_action( 'plugins_loaded', function() {
	remove_filter( 'comments_template', array( 'HMN_Comment_Popularity', 'custom_comments_template' ) );
}, 100 );`

Secondly, you need to add replace the `wp_list_comments` call with the following code:

`if ( function_exists( 'hmn_cp_the_sorted_comments' ) ) {
	hmn_cp_the_sorted_comments( $args );
} else {
	wp_list_comments();
}`

Finally, you need to add the following function to your custom comment template where you would like to output the voting icons.

`hmn_cp_the_comment_upvote_form();`

To display the comment author karma:

`hmn_cp_the_comment_author_karma();`
